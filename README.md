## Create a New Folder

Start by creating a folder with any name.

Open Visual Studio Code in a new window (Ctrl + Shift + N) and drag and drop your newly created folder into VS Code.

Now, open the terminal inside VS Code (`Ctrl + ``) and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app@latest
   ```
Note:
The difference between npm and npx is that npm installs tools globally, whereas npx allows you to run tools without global installation.

## Choose the Folder for Installation

You can install the project in the main folder using ./ or create a sub-folder with a different name if you prefer.
## Reset the Project

To reset the in-built project structure, run this command:

   ```bash
   npm run reset-project.js
   ```
After resetting, feel free to delete any unnecessary folders such as the duplicate app folder or the hooks folder.

## Start the Project
To start your project, run:

   ```bash
    npx expo start -c
   ```
This will start your Expo project with cache clearing (-c).

## Running on Android
Ensure your phone and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, or you can use a USB cable for connection.
To run the project on an Android emulator, open Android Studio, and in the terminal, press a to run the Android emulator.
Press ? in the terminal to view more options for managing the emulator.
